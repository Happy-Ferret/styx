I've recorded some dead ends and false starts that I've had during
this process. They may help explain the decisions I made to arrive
at the current API and implementation.

# The Scanner

# The sliding window

The sliding.Window did not work out as well as I had hoped,
at least not as it currently works. The main issues are:

- We don't know when the window will shift on the next
  call to Fetch. As a result, we're stuck to using one block
  of memory at a time. This prevents us from processing
  messages in parallel over the same connection.
- Once someone takes out a Reader, you can't touch the
   window until they are done with it. It is very easy to
   make a mistake.
- It does not deal cleanly with Readers that are partially
   in the buffer and partially still waiting to be Read.

# bufio.Reader plus a buffer

This introduced a copy, which kind of defeats the purpose
of the flatBuffers approach.
